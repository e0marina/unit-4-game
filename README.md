# Crystal Collector Game 

go to https://e0marina.github.io/unit-4-game/ for deployed game. 

Game Instructions: You will be given a random number at the start of the game.


There are four crystals. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.


You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.


The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it (try and remember each crystals value).


Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.

This is a game I made in UCLA Bootcamp.
